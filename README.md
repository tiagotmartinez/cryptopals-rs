# Cryptopals-rs

Solutions to the [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com) in Rust.

I had already completed many of those challenges in other programming languages, but wanted to test in Rust both as a form of practice and study, and because I kept seeing lots of references to Rust being a good language for crypto work.

This repository is incomplete, but I plan to keep adding stuff as I have time to work on it.

The current status is:
* Set 1 is **complete**
* Set 2 is **complete**
* Set 3 is **complete**
* Set 4 is **complete**
* Set 5 is **halfway**
* Sets 6 to 7 I have not started
